**dedaub-monitoring** is a command-line interface (CLI) for the [Dedaub](https://app.dedaub.com) monitoring platform. It lets you write SQL queries against on-chain data on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, test them, and deploy real-time blockchain alerts — all from your terminal.

Use it to monitor on-chain activity and get notified about large transfers, fund drains, liquidations, oracle price deviations, privileged admin/owner actions, and any other event you can express in SQL. The package name is `monitoring-cli` and the installed command is `dedaub-monitoring`.

**Use cases:** smart-contract monitoring, DeFi protocol monitoring, security monitoring, on-chain alerting, and blockchain data analysis across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and other EVM chains.

## Installation

Pick the path that matches what you already have — all three end with the same installed `dedaub-monitoring` command.

### From scratch — one command (recommended)

The bootstrap installer does the whole setup: it installs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if it's missing (uv also provides the right Python, so you don't install Python yourself), installs the CLI, installs the agent skill, and starts login. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It assumes `git` is already present (uv uses it to fetch the package) and will tell you if it isn't; everything else it handles.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dedaub/monitoring-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dedaub/monitoring-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Re-run any time to upgrade. The only step that isn't automated is the browser login, which prints a URL for you to open.

### Already have uv — one line

uv installs the CLI straight from the public repo over HTTPS — no clone, no SSH keys, and uv fetches the pinned Python for you:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Dedaub/monitoring-cli
dedaub-monitoring install-skill
dedaub-monitoring login
```

### Contributors — from a clone

If you're hacking on the CLI, work from a checkout. From a clone, `make setup` runs the whole onboarding against your working tree:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dedaub/monitoring-cli.git
cd monitoring-cli
make setup   # uv tool install . --force  +  install-skill  +  login
```

The skill picker and the login browser flow are interactive, so you stay in control of those two steps. Re-authenticate any time with `make login`.

## Authentication

```bash
dedaub-monitoring login    # or: make login
```

This opens a browser-based OAuth2 device flow. Your credentials are stored locally and reused across sessions; run `logout` to clear them. Every command accepts `--profile/-p` to keep separate credential sets (e.g. work vs personal).

## Usage

### Browse your queries

```bash
dedaub-monitoring tree
```

### Create a query

```bash
dedaub-monitoring create-folder "/My Alerts"
dedaub-monitoring create-query "/My Alerts/large-eth-transfer"
```

### Write SQL

```bash
dedaub-monitoring write-query --id 1234 <<'SQL'
SELECT
    encode(t.tx_hash, 'hex') AS tx_hash,
    encode(t.from_a, 'hex') AS sender,
    t.callvalue / 1e18 AS eth_amount,
    t.block_number
FROM {{outer_transaction(network='ethereum')}} t
WHERE t.callvalue > 100 * 1e18
  AND t.status = true
SQL
```

### Enable alerts

```bash
dedaub-monitoring enable-alerts \
  --id 1234 \
  --frequency 300 \
  --network ethereum \
  --alert-template "{{sender}} sent {{eth_amount}} ETH (tx: {{tx_hash}})" \
  --unique-key "tx_hash" \
  --email
```

`--network` (default `ethereum`) selects the chain the alert's run config and notifications
apply to — set it to match the network used in your query's macros (e.g. `arbitrum`, `base`).
The same `--network` option is available on `set-config`, `get-config`, `disable-alerts`, and
`list-alerts`.

### Check execution logs

```bash
dedaub-monitoring get-logs --id 1234
```

### See fired alerts

```bash
dedaub-monitoring get-alerts --id 1234
```

### Test a query

```bash
dedaub-monitoring run-query --id 1234 --duration 1h --limit 20
```

### Explore the schema

```bash
dedaub-monitoring get-schema --network ethereum
dedaub-monitoring get-schema --network ethereum --macros
```

## DedaubQL

Queries use DedaubQL, a dialect of SQL with macros that handle time-bounded incremental execution. Always use macros instead of raw table names:

```sql
-- Use this
FROM {{outer_transaction(network='ethereum')}} t

-- Not this (causes full table scans and timeouts)
FROM ethereum.outer_transaction t
```

Key macros: `{{outer_transaction(network='ethereum')}}`, `{{logs(network='ethereum')}}`, `{{contracts(network='ethereum')}}`.

All address and hash columns are `bytea`. Use `\x`-prefixed literals in WHERE clauses and `encode(col, 'hex')` in SELECT for readable output:

```sql
WHERE t.to_a = '\x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d'
```

## Claude Code skill

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), install the `/dedaub-monitoring` skill to get an AI-guided alert builder:

```bash
dedaub-monitoring install-skill
```

The skill ships in the shared "Agent Skills" format, so it can install to more than just Claude. With no flags, in a terminal you get a checkbox picker; otherwise it installs to Claude plus any other supported agent already present on the machine. Choose targets explicitly with `--agent`, or install everywhere with `--all`:

```bash
dedaub-monitoring install-skill --agent claude --agent codex   # specific agents
dedaub-monitoring install-skill --all                          # claude, codex, cursor, .agents
```

### Install the skill on its own

The skill is published straight from this repository, so an agent can pull it without the Python CLI. Both routes below read [`.claude-plugin/`](.claude-plugin/), where `marketplace.json` and `plugin.json` point at the packaged skill in [`packages/dedaub-skills/`](packages/dedaub-skills/).

With [`npx skills`](https://skills.sh), which supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and 70+ other agents:

```bash
npx skills add Dedaub/monitoring-cli
```

As a Claude Code plugin, which keeps it current with `/plugin marketplace update`:

```
/plugin marketplace add Dedaub/monitoring-cli
/plugin install dedaub-monitoring@dedaub
```

Installed as a plugin, the skill is namespaced: run `/dedaub-monitoring:dedaub-monitoring`. The skill drives the `dedaub-monitoring` command, so keep the CLI on your PATH — see [Installation](#installation).

Then type `/dedaub-monitoring` in Claude Code (or your agent) to start a session. The skill guides you through researching a protocol, writing alert queries, reviewing them, and deploying them.

## Commands

The [Usage](#usage) walkthrough above covers the common path — log in, create a query, write SQL, enable alerts. This is the full reference, grouped by what you're doing: the **Account & session** commands get you set up, and the **Operations** sub-sections cover everything you do to existing queries afterwards.

Commands that act on a query or folder take it **either** by `--id <id>` **or** by `--path /Folder/Name` (add `--entity-id` to reach another entity's tree), so once you know what you want you can edit it directly without browsing first. Every command also accepts `--profile/-p`.

#### Verify webhook deliveries

Pass an optional shared secret when you create or test a webhook:

```bash
export DEDAUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="replace-with-a-random-secret"

dedaub-monitoring webhook create \
  --name "security-alerts" \
  --url "https://alerts.example.com/dedaub" \
  --secret "$DEDAUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

Dedaub includes that value verbatim in the `x-webhook-secret` header of every
request. It is a shared authentication secret, not an HMAC signature. Require
HTTPS and compare the header with the expected value before processing the
request. This dependency-free Node.js helper uses a constant-time comparison:

```js
import { timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

export function isDedaubWebhook(request) {
  const supplied = request.headers["x-webhook-secret"];
  if (typeof supplied !== "string") return false;

  const expected = Buffer.from(process.env.DEDAUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET ?? "");
  const received = Buffer.from(supplied);

  return (
    expected.length > 0 &&
    expected.length === received.length &&
    timingSafeEqual(expected, received)
  );
}
```

Avoid logging the header value. The full test payload and delivery behaviour
are documented in [Dedaub's webhook documentation](https://docs.dedaub.com/docs/settings/Webhooks/).

## FAQ

### What is dedaub-monitoring?

`dedaub-monitoring` is a command-line tool for the Dedaub monitoring platform. You write SQL (DedaubQL) queries against on-chain Ethereum and EVM data, test them, and deploy real-time alerts that notify you by email when matching activity occurs.

### How do I monitor on-chain activity from the command line?

Install the CLI (`uv tool install .`), authenticate with `dedaub-monitoring login`, create a query with `create-query`, write your SQL with `write-query`, and enable notifications with `enable-alerts`. The query runs incrementally on a schedule and fires alerts when rows match.

### How do I set up real-time alerts for large token or ETH transfers?

Write a query that selects transfers above a threshold (see the [large ETH transfer example](#write-sql) above), then run `enable-alerts` with an `--alert-template` and `--unique-key` so each transfer is reported once. Set `--frequency` to control how often the query runs.

### Which blockchains and networks are supported?

Any chain supported by the Dedaub monitoring platform, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base. Select the chain with the `--network` option (default `ethereum`) and the matching network argument inside your DedaubQL macros (e.g. `{{outer_transaction(network='arbitrum')}}`).

### How do I monitor a smart contract or DeFi protocol for drains, liquidations, or admin actions?

Query the protocol's logs and calls with the `{{logs(...)}}` and `{{outer_transaction(...)}}` macros, filter for the events you care about (large withdrawals, liquidation calls, owner/admin function selectors, oracle updates), and enable alerts on the query. The Claude Code skill (`dedaub-monitoring install-skill`) can build these queries for you from a plain-language description.

### Do I write raw SQL or a special dialect?

You write **DedaubQL**, a dialect of SQL with macros for time-bounded incremental execution. Always use macros (e.g. `{{outer_transaction(network='ethereum')}}`) instead of raw table names to avoid full table scans. See [DedaubQL](#dedaubql) above.

### Is there an AI-assisted way to build alerts?

Yes. If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), run `dedaub-monitoring install-skill` and type `/dedaub-monitoring` to get an AI-guided alert builder that researches a protocol, writes the query, and deploys the alert.
